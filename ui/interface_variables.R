ui_home_desc_1 = "The Seven Bridges BCO App provides tools for generating BioCompute Objects and tools for working with BioCompute Objects. The BCO App can generate BioCompute Objects from user text input, workflows written in Common Workflow Language (CWL), and from CWL/task information generated on the Cancer Genomics Cloud. The BCO App also includes tools for reviewing and validating BioCompute Objects. This version of the BCO App extends our initial prototype developed for the precisionFDA BioCompute Object Challenge."
