The Genomics Compliance Suite can generate BioCompute Objects from user text input, workflows written in Common Workflow Language, and from task information generated on the Cancer Genomics Cloud. The Genomics Compliance Suite also include tppls for revievin and valdiating BioCompute Objects. This version of the Genomics Compliance Suite extends our initial prototype developed for the precisionFDA BioCompute Object Challenge."
